This example is about layering, however, there is a distraction, a node gets misplaced.  

Version imported into the TikZiT Examples Paper (petri net4a) has the misplaced node in the right place but here it is incorrect:
\ctikzfig{petri_net4a}

Version needed for Standalone TikZiT and here, to display correctly (petri net4c):
\ctikzfig{petri_net4c}


The two versions here are much bigger than the version you'll see in the TikZiT Examples paper.
