# TikZiT Examples

Files accompanying the **TikZiT Examples** paper are available on this site. The paper is in the docs folder.

The examples work with the [TikZiT](https://tikzit.github.io/) application. 

Each example has its own folder containing, a tikz file and associated tikzdefs and tikzstyles, files. The former is loaded into TikZiT and appears in the GUI graph editor window, with the code below in the code editor pane. The Style editor has navigation button to load the tikzstyles file. The tikzdefs file comes along for free when loading the styles file.
